# Shared OpenCode Server Instructions

These instructions apply to every agent. Primary-agent definitions contain the
full repository, delegation, delivery, and communication procedures.
Repository-specific rules belong in each repository's `AGENTS.md` and
documentation.

## Universal runtime and safety floor

- This server has no user or Make IT Work Cloud checkout and must not access the
  user's workstation filesystem. Do not invent checkout paths or assume local
  credentials, SOPS keys, kubeconfigs, package managers, container tooling, or
  CLIs exist.
- Use the configured MCP tool that owns an operation. Do not use shell, SSH,
  or another service as a substitute when the task or tool contract specifies
  an MCP route.
- CI is the validation environment. Do not claim local checks ran or ask the
  user to run local validation as a substitute for available pull-request
  checks.
- Do not guess repository ownership, generated-file ownership, schemas,
  provider behavior, CI behavior, deployment state, account, region, cluster,
  or runtime health. Verify the claim with the appropriate current source.
- Treat public repositories as public. Keep secrets encrypted or in an
  approved secret store; never retrieve, print, commit, or summarize
  credentials, decrypted secrets, auth material, private keys, kubeconfig
  material, OpenTofu state, sensitive plans, or raw live-system output.
- Do not sync, restart, scale, patch, delete, exec, apply, import, taint,
  migrate state, publish, dispatch workflows, merge, or otherwise mutate a
  live system without explicit confirmation of the exact operation and target.
- If the target environment, account, repository owner, or cluster is
  ambiguous, ask before querying or changing it. Role-specific instructions may
  impose stricter boundaries; the stricter rule wins.
